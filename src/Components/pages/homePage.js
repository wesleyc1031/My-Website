                   My name is Wesley and I am a 22 year old Computer Science graduate at New York Institute of Technology. I graduated in May of 2019 and I am currently looking for a full time position as a Front 
                   End Engineer, Back End Engineer, Full Stack Engineer, or Software Engineer. My prefered occupation is a Front End Engineer, but I don't mind working the latter jobs. I decided to make this website
                   because I have always wanted to have my very own website ever since I was a kid and what better way to accomplish that goal while also testing and improving on my Front End skills. This website is
                   essentially an extension of my resume while also giving you guys more of an insight about me as a person, such as my hobbies. The entirety of this website was built from the ground up using React.
                   I do plan on continuely updating my website when I think of new ideas that would make the website a lot better. <br />
